      "At Nypunya optimum care is assured through advanced technology. US FDA approved platform device (FRAXIS DUO) is used. This incorporates Fractional Ablative CO2 laser and Fractional Microneedle Radiofrequency system.",
      "The fractional CO2 laser delivers non contagious microscopic columns of heat energy into the deeper layers of the skin preserving the intervening skin. This will help in the repairing process and forming new collagen and collagen remodelling. The ultimate result is improvement in appearance of the scars.",
      "Fractional Microneedling Radiofrequency: This combines mechanical and thermal induced tissue changes to stimulate new collagen formation resulting in improvement of the scar and tightening of the tissue.",
      "When both the modalities are combined, excellent results are obtained for various kinds of scars, significantly reducing the down time and incidence of potential side effects."
